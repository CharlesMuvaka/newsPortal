#### <span style="color:white">by Charles Muvaka</span>

NewsPortal is an Api that enables users to add and retrieve information concerning the employees, department and News relating to the entire organisation and departments.

To use the postgres database run the create.sql script in the `src/create.sql` folder in the project directory
or run the following:

````sql
CREATE DATABASE news_portal;
\c news_portal

CREATE TABLE workers(
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
workername VARCHAR,
workerposition VARCHAR,
departmentid INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE departments(
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR,
description VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE news(
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
topic VARCHAR,
description VARCHAR,
departmentid INTEGER
);
````
Note the database name is `news_portal` if using the postgres database

## <span style="color:Greenyellow"> Prerequisites</span>

- Basic knowledge of On Git CLI
- Java 11
- Gradle as a built tool
- IntelliJ or any Java based IDE
- postgres SQL sever installed
- Postman desktop client installed

## <span style="color:Green">Technologies</span>

- Java 11
- Gradle
- Spark
- JUnit
- Postgres Sql

## <span style="color:Green">Installation</span>

1. Clone or download repository as an archive
2. If archive unzip the archive to get project folder
3. Open the application's root folder in an IDE that can execute builds in java using gradle e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse.
4. Navigate to the Main.java file and run the `main` class
5. Use the link below to access the labeled request collection in Postman web,fork the collection into your personal workspace.
- "https://www.postman.com/dark-rocket-354200/workspace/team-workspace/collection/20876568-ce40f82f-3c9a-492d-a71e-119eed23c031?action=share&creator=20876568"
6. For testing use Postman desktop client to access the forked collection because their cloud client does not access
   local ports like `localhost:4567`.
7. In postman replace where indicated `:id` the number with the id you want to use in the path variables
8. Make sure you recreate the database in your local psql by running the psql commands above.
9. If you do not fork the already created postman collection make sure to enter and label yours correctly to avoid errors because of extra spaces or missing characters
